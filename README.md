Pollution_project:

This project utilizes libraries such as NumPy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn, imported from Anaconda.
The project employs three models from scikit-learn: Logistic Regression, KNeighbors Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.
Model evaluation involved various techniques, including train_test_split, cross_val_score, RandomizedSearchCV, StandardScaler, LabelEncoder, confusion_matrix, classification_report, accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, and roc_auc_score.
The data analysis began with categorizing pollution into four categories: Good, Moderate, Poor, and Hazardous.
After data analysis, model training was done, using 80% of the data for training purposes.
After training, 20% of the data was used for testing to evaluate  model performance.
Finally, I generated a report predicting the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
The project also features a confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the predictions.
Seaborn was utilized later for visualizations.
The confusion matrix was presented as a heat map using seaborn for clearer visualization.
Lastly, the four metrics were evaluated using cross-validation techniques.
I conducted feature analysis to identify important features and visualized them using a matplotlib graph.
At last, new data was given for prediction.

This pollution prediction project leverages Python libraries like NumPy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn, accessed through Anaconda. It employs three models—Logistic Regression, KNN Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier—and uses various model evaluation techniques like cross-validation, confusion matrix, and ROC AUC score. The data was analyzed and categorized into four pollution levels: Good, Moderate, Poor, and Hazardous. After training on 80% of the data, the models were evaluated on the remaining 20%. Feature importance was analyzed and visualized, and predictions were made on new data to classify pollution levels.
